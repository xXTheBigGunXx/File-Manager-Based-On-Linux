# File-Manager-Based-On-Linux
Custom file manager written in CPP based on a Linux file management commnds.

I choose this project because I was really interested in file manipulation and command line arguments. It also seemed that it would be helpful to create these Linux commands because I plan on swtiching to Linux.

I learnt from this project:
* Some basic git functionalities like 'inti', 'push', 'commit'. I also learnt how to work with remote repository.
* Learnt how to search for documentation for <filesystem> and <fstream> and truly understand how and what function do.
* Learnt to handle exceptions and put safety features.
* Learnt to work with multiple files.
* Learnt to use advanced CPP features like lambdas, function pointers, recursion, inline and noexcept functions.
